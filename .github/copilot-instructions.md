# Copilot instructions

## Repo overview
- This repo currently contains a single documentation file: [README.md](README.md). Treat it as the source of truth for course information.
- Content is in Spanish and uses Markdown headings and lists. Preserve the existing tone and structure.
- The is an university course is about signal processing, based on python and electronics. The author is trying to translate existing matlab scripts to python.

## Content structure & patterns
- The README is organized by top-level sections (e.g., Recomendaciones, Encuestas, Recursos de la clase, Horario, Objetivos, Formato, Evaluación, Temario, Bibliografía).
- Use horizontal separators made of dashes to split major sections, matching the existing style in [README.md](README.md).
- Maintain the current list formatting and indentation for subsections (e.g., numbered lists under Recomendaciones, bullet lists under Temario).

## Editing guidance
- When updating content, keep section titles consistent with the table of contents already present in [README.md](README.md).
- Do not introduce build/test instructions or tooling commands unless they are present in the repo; none are documented today.
- If adding new materials, place them in the most relevant existing section rather than creating new top-level sections unless explicitly requested.

## Known gaps
- There are no source code directories, build scripts, or tests in the repository at this time.
- If new files or folders are added later, update these instructions to reflect the new structure and workflows.

## General instructions
- Do not invent. If you dont understand or know something, ask for clarification.
- Do not generate code untill explicitly asked.
